# AdventOfCode2024

Welcome to my repository for storing my solutions to [`Advent of Code 2024`](https://adventofcode.com/)! Feel free to glance at my (admittedly horrendous) solutions for the problems firsthand!  

This year, I have decided to solve AoC in __Python__, for no particular reason apart from treating this as a challenge to me, since I usually struggle in working with Python in general (too used to using __JavaScript__ lol). Let's see how far I can go!
